<div>
    Follow the Ant glob syntax or absolute file path to specify the files to upload.<br />
    Multiple inputs are accepted if separated by semi-colons.<br />
    The base directory is the workspace.<br />
    Examples: 
    <br />    1. build/*.jar
    <br />    2. **/*.jar
    <br />    3. build/*.zip;build/*.jar
    <br />    4. c:/libs/mysample.jar 
    
    <br/><br/>Environment variables and system environment variables are allowed.

    <br/>For each group of artifacts, you can also specify the URL path that those files will be uploaded to by using '::' after the source path and entering a name for that URL part. e.g. build/*.jar::binaries;build/*.txt::notices

<br><br>The final upload URL for each group of artifacts is constructed as follows, where &lt;group-path&gt; represents that last group URL path part:

<br><br>http://&lt;storage-account-name&gt;.&lt;azure-bob-service-endpoint&gt;/&lt;container-name&gt;/&lt;common-virtual-path&gt;/&lt;group-path&gt;/&lt;artifacts-file-name&gt;

<br><br>For example:
<br>http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/mycommonvirtualpath/mygrouppath/myartifact.jar
